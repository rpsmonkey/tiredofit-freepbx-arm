# In a send only installation you may want to use faxgetty
# or faxmodem on lines already configured with faxaddmodem.
# faxgetty is the new default, faxmodem the old one.
# For a better understanding of the difference between faxmodem
# and faxgetty, see http://www.hylafax.org/archive/1999-09/msg00043.php

# In a send/receive installation you must use faxgetty.
#
# To use faxmodem change the following variable value to "no".

# You may also prefer to run faxmodem/faxgetty via inittab instead of
# running it here from a script. In this case set its value as
# "init".
